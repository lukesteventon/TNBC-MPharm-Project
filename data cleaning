```{r}
setwd("/Users/luke/Documents/TNBC MPharm Project")
table1<-read.csv("OFFICIAL_SENSITIVE_ODR1920_300_TABLE1_Pinkie_Chambers_15092022.csv")
table2<-read.csv("OFFICIAL_SENSITIVE_ODR1920_300_TABLE2_Pinkie_Chambers_15092022.csv")
table3<-read.csv("OFFICIAL_SENSITIVE_ODR1920_300_TABLE3_Pinkie_Chambers_15092022.csv")
table4<-read.csv("OFFICIAL_SENSITIVE_ODR1920_300_TABLE4_Pinkie_Chambers_03102022.csv")
```
Firstly we need to join these tables together using the common pseudonymised ID:
```{r}
table12<-table1 %>% 
  merge(table2, by = "PSEUDONYMISED_PATIENTID")
```
We need to identify triple negative patients. We will do this using ER_STATUS, PR_STATUS and HER2_STATUS:
```{r}
#These lines of code filter the table for patients who have ER, PR and HER2 status listed as N - negative.
table12<-table12 %>% 
  filter(ER_STATUS=="N") %>% 
  filter(PR_STATUS=="N") %>% 
  filter(HER2_STATUS=="N")

table12 #n=1,720 patients who we know are triple negative.
```
We need to attach the date of surgery to each patient's record. Surgery information is contained in table 3.
```{r}
library(lubridate)
table3<-table3 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(EVENTDESC, "Surgery"))
```
Exclusion: we have agreed to define surgery related to chemotherapy as being performed within 6 months of the start of chemo. 
We have checked the administration dates of the chemotherapy to confirm this was 1/1/2014. 
Therefore we will exclude surgeries performed more than 6 months before 2014 as we do not consider these to be associated with the chemotherapy given after.
```{r}
table3<-table3 %>% 
  mutate(EVENTDATE=lubridate::dmy(EVENTDATE)) %>% 
  filter(EVENTDATE>"2013/07/01")
#This step has excluded surgeries performed more than 6 months before the study period we are interested in.
```
Next steps:
Consider how we handle patients who have multiple surgeries?
Do we assume the surgery closest to their chemotherapy is the actual date of surgery, and not a biopsy date?
